	<p>We developed the iPad version of this app. Broadway.org is The Broadway League's official on-line headquarters for Broadway information in NYC, as well as for shows on tour across North America. Get tickets at all price points to every current and upcoming show, direct from the theatres' official ticketing offices. The app also provides up-to-date show and theatre information in six languages, as well as a guide to hotel and dining options in Manhattan's Theatre District, and general information about Broadway theatre going.  </p>
