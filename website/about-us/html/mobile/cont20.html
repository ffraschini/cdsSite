	<p>Seacoast.com is an e-commerce that specializes in helping people achive proper nutrition and natural health (all based on clinical research), through a catalog of Vitamins, Supplements, Herbs and Minerals. Among other tasks, we re-implemented the Q&amp;A system and added a voting system to this section. Also, we integrated the site with Facebook, added AJAX to the shopping cart to delete and change items from the list, we improved the security system and implemented a products tag system. </p>
