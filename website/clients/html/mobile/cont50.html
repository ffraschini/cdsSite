	<p>We worked with Card Scanning Solutions (CSSN) to develop idScan GO, an application that extracts and stores textual information, face image, and signature image from a driver's license to a portable device. The application uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, which converts data from scanned documents into computer-editable text that can be populated into other applications; and digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms which filter and clean tarnished images - this core technology differentiates the solution from other OCR applications.</p>
