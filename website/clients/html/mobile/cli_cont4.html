	<p>"CodigoDelSur was a pleasant surprise. I will definitely hire them again next project. It all started with the briefing phase and project overall estimation. It helped scale team size. Programmers were quick and efficient in their work. But I did not even have to worry about it. The key element to this was the project coordinator. It interfaces with all teams (IT backend, programming, design and client - myself) to provide precise deadlines and task coordination. My IT backend team, for instance, that programmed the server side wasn't even CodigoDelSur and I did not have to worry about this issue. One of them was in Canada, the other one in remote area of Brazil and designer in another. Application was delivered on-time and work was very well documented and reported in realtime through latest technologies such as Pivotal Tracking." Dario Souza</p>
