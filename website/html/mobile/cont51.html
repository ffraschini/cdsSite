	<p>We worked with Card Scanning Solutions (CSSN) to develop MedicScan GO, an application that extracts and stores textual information on a portable device from a medical insurance card image. The application uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, which converts data from scanned documents into computer-editable text that can be populated into other applications; and digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms which filter and clean tarnished images - this core technology differentiates the solution from other OCR applications.</p>
