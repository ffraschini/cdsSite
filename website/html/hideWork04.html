	<div class="infoWork"><p>Cortexa is a home management technology. With this software a user can manage their house from virtually anywhere, even when they’re not at home. It comes with a special hardware to be installed at the house, and a user interface that can be accessed from any pc, mac, or mobile device. 
		<br><br>Some of the functionality it offers are: light control, thermostat control, security (alarm set up), irrigation, leak detection, cameras, audio, weather forecast, modes setup and programming
		<br><br>We worked side by side with the client for almost seven months to developed some sections of the Energy Saving edition released on July 2011. 
		<br><br>The project begun with the weather forecast service, that consisted in finding a proper free online weather provider and integrating it with the Cortexa software.
		<br><br>We also developed the mode system, which is one of the featured functionalities of the new version. This system allows one to set up different modes for the house. Each mode has a group of dispositions that sets default temperatures, lighting, and irrigation when the mode is activated. 
		<br><br>We also helped them develop a prototype to present for a hospitality project, being Cortexa’s next big challenge in this industry: to develop a similar system for hotels.</p></div>
