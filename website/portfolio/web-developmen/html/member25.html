							<h4>First Name: Carlos 
							<BR>Last Name: Navas
							<BR>Programmer
							<!-- <BR>Hobbie: Playing soccer and listening to music</h4> -->
<!-- 							The every solution man! Son of a motherboard, his programming and analytical capabilities have no limits. He programs connecting his PC to his mind through a government chip implanted in his brain (just kidding! but it’s true that he is THAT good!). He’s also a great friend and team player, always there when needed. He also keeps on repeating that a problem isn't a problem unless it has a solution.
