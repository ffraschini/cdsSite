	<p>GoWrite is practical, easy to use and helps students become better writers. You may use GoWrite to construct and manage hundreds of papers. Easily sort and search for saved papers. Papers may be saved and accessed through the various stages of writing and accessed for reference or a “restart” at any point along the process from draft to publish. </p>
