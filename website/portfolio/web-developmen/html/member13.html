<!-- 							Enrique is a major game implementer, a field in which we can call him an expert. Although he isn't into playing ping-pong, his countless hours of training will pay off someday. He can help you solve the hardest Objective-C challenges and heâ€™s a great coworker. But when office time is over and you are playing ping-pong with him, you suddenly become his worst enemy. He takes it seriously!
