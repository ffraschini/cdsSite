							<h4>First Name: Diego

							<BR>Programmer
							<!-- <BR>Hobbie: Sports in general, but especially Soccer </h4> -->
<!-- 							Diego is a great programmer with lots of experience. His programming skills are only matched by his football skills - which he doesn't hesitate to show off at our traditional wednesday football game even though he's pretty new at the office. Some people say he's pretty good at cooking too, so he's not only a full stack developer but a full stack guy.
