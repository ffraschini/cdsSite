	<p>We developed two native applications, one for iPad (all versions) and one for Android Tablet “Samsung Galaxy tab”. Each app was basically a web browser to access The Hub’s website, using login credentials and interface as usual. 
	<br><br>We worked on three main aspects: 1) we created two new CSS (iPad / Samsung Galaxy tab) to solve the visual issues that the website had while viewing it in a tablet, 2) we incorporated the capability of accessing the tablet's camera so the user could take or pick a photo/video to upload, and 3) we added the capability of scanning or entering a barcode to upload and be processed by the server.</p>
