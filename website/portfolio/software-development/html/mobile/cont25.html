	<p>Next Generation Education is a tutoring program for children between 6 and 17 years old 
	divided into two groups: primary learning (from 6 to 12 years old) and secondary learning 
	(from 13 to 17 years old). The system includes two big learning topics: Mathematics and 
	English (grammar, reading and writing). For each topic there are different levels that the 
	student will have to pass and depend on the age of the student. After a level is completed,
	the score is calculated depending on which a different animation will be displayed. Therefore,
	the system also required the design of animations with a carnival theme. The scores obtained
	by the student may be redeemed for different predefined prizes.
