	Stephen Moyer invented a social media app (Weev) and we're the developers! Check out this video of him at the Jimmy Fallon show: <a src="http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/segments/8621">http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/segments/8621</a> 
	</br>We're very happy to be a part of the Weev team! Weev, is social video that talks back. Ask any question, and have the world answer it in short videos that are stitched together to give you all the insight you need. And, if you are too shy to ask, knock yourself out responding to as many questions you like.
