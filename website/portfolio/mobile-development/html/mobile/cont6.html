	<p>IISIS is a powerful, web-based software that brings clinical 
	collaboration and remote 
	patient monitoring to a new level.</p>
	<p>	IISIS is designed to provide clinics with ultimate access to medical device data. 
	IISIS displays device and patient data, alarms and real time waveforms which can be
	accessed from a central monitoring workstation within the hospital (intranet) or
	remotely from anywhere, anytime, through a secure authorized internet connection.</p>
	<p>We developed the entire mobile application and currently provide support, maintenance,
	and add new functionalities for the whole software.
	Additionally they asked us to develop another application called "Partners Portal"
	intended to upload and manage sensitive documents and facilitate their delivery in 
	a secure manner to vendor credentialing services or hospital HR departments.
