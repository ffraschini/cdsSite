	<p>Holiday Crowd is a website developed in Java that connects 
	Travellers with professional travel agents, providing interactive 
	pages to create highly customizable trips. </p>
	<p>We created everything from scratch - from the database 
	design to the user interface and design, including the whole 
	system’s logic. This site works with ajax powered javascript 
	in order to give the user a smooth experience, so they can 
	create complete trips without reloading pages. </p>
	<p>It has a ‘powerful tag’ feature that allows trips to be
	tagged and sent to relevant travel agents 
	registered in the site, automatically sending emails to
	travellers and agents when they receive bids on their requests or
	comments on their bids, among many other possible notifications.</p>
	<p>It is fully integrated with PayPal; travellers can book their 
	trips through an online process.</p>
