<!-- 		If you are looking for someone who knows what MKMapKitis are, you should stop looking. Pablo is the one who knows
		all about how to turn an iPhone into a hurricane tracker, a device to never forget where you parked your car, a
		multiplayer game board, or basically whatever you want and never imagined was possible. When he is not with an
		Apple device in his hands, he enjoys watching some anime or attending costume parties where he can see his favorite
		heroines in real life.
