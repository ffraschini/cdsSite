	<p>"I get asked all the time, "How do I find a technical partner to build my idea?" I say, don't. Use Codigo Del Sur. The team setup is wonderful, there is great support from project management, and all the devs in house get to ask each other tough questions. They're really smart, nice people. I never have to worry about the time zone and I can't wait to visit Montevideo! Thank you for always being there for us". Neal Bozeman</p>
