		<h4>First Name: Juan 
		<BR>Last Name: Garcia
		<BR>Programmer
		<!-- <BR>Hobbie: Reading and running</h4> -->
<!-- 		Juan is a passionate guy and very crazy about mobile device programing. He is always trying to innovate and look beyond the regular developer. His biggest strengths (and weaknesses) are apple and android, being a complete obsession for him. His main weakness as a software developer is in the table tennis court, where he has never been seen winning a match since he is a member of our team.
