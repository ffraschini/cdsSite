							<h4>First Name: Ignacio 
							<BR>Last Name: Rodrigo
							<BR>Programmer
							<!-- <BR>Hobbie: Guitar playing and cycling</h4> -->
<!-- 							Ignacio is a free mind that enjoys programming crazy ideas in Java, when he’s not doing kamikaze-style mountain biking. When he isn't doing extreme sports, he takes pleasure in playing the guitar, enjoying nirvana-like moments of spiritual elevation. Also, as this apparently isn't enough, he’s an electrician in the making and utmost, one of our staff members that NEVER misses out on an after office gathering or a weekend party!
