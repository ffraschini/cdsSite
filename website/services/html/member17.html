							<h4>First Name: Noelia 
							<BR>Last Name: Chevalier
							<BR>Programmer
							<!-- <BR>Hobbie: Walking her dog while listening to music and playing tennis</h4> -->
<!-- 							Noelia is a great team worker and is always ready to face new challenges with a great attitude and extreme dedication. She also has great concentration capacity; she will keep programming even when the other team members are singing a terrible song off key. She is an expert in Java / Flex, asynchronous communication and a dog lover. So if youâ€™re planning to give her a gift, a little puppy would be a good choice.
