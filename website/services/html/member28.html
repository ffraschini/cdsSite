							<BR>Programmer
							<!-- <BR>Hobbie: Cars and video games</h4> -->
<!-- 							Also known as "El Pulpo" (The Octopus), he’s an extremely active person that never runs out of energy. He can develop an application while he serves "Mate" to his co-workers and helps the entire team with his 100% positive attitude. He loves a challenge and every kind of difficulty makes him feel right at home. A great programmer, a hard worker and also a football fan (and player). He’s always open for dialogue, except when talking about sports. He’s the guy that if he isn't behind a computer, then he is outside breathing some fresh air, no matter the weather!
