	<p>System that facilitates and automates the purchase of tickets for events (music, sports and more) from sites like Ticketmaster. It parses information from sellerâ€™s pages located in the United States, handling five different ticket provider companies.
<br><br>When you enter a specific event, it shows information such as the URL where the purchase will be made. Then, as you set different parameters like number of tickets to be collected, location, price range, and date it expires, etc. the program searches for entries that meet the requirements. When found, the information is displayed and the option to purchase is enabled.
