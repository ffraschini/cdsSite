						Gabriel is the HTML and CSS guru that can make your website look good even in Internet Explorer 3. With a lot of experience, an extraordinary quick learning ability and infinite patience, he’s always willing to help others and teach the new ones everything they should know. He’s also a very practical and fast guy who always has good ideas. In addition, his mother makes the BEST chocolate cakes - we all wish we could celebrate his birthday more often!
