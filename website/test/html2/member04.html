		<h4>First Name: Luciano 
		<BR>Last Name: Alvarez
		<BR>Project Manager
		<BR>Hobbie: Guitar playing</h4>
		Luciano is a positive leader who is always there when needed. He’s great at motivating the team and an expert in a variety of programming languages. Although he will always be in love with Pascal, to the point of doing a matrix screensaver in it just for fun, his wide range of skills make him the essential puzzle piece in every project. A competitive guy by nature, he’s always waiting for the next tournament (from football to "Truco") to demonstrate his skills and win - or at least try.
