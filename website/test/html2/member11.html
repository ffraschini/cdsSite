							<h4>First Name: Federico 
							<BR>Last Name: Fraschini
							<BR>Programmer
							<BR>Hobbie: Sailing</h4>
							Fede is the kind of person that is it fun to work with; he transforms the hardest tasks into enjoyable and entertaining experiences. As a programmer, he masters Adobe Flex and ActionScript to perfection so this, added to the fact that it is gratifying to work with him, makes him the perfect co-worker! At his spare time he likes to ride his motorbike and show his networking skills by coming to the rescue and installing the router properly when everyone else has given up.
