							<h4>First Name: Andres 
							<BR>Last Name: Mora
							<BR>Designer
							<BR>Hobbie: Listening to music, reading and running</h4>
							Andres is our star designer. A brilliant and creative guy who can create a parallel universe in his mind and make it real on the computer as no one else can. With infinite patience, he manages to interpret our clients’ most changeling wishes, translating them into a design that always exceeds expectations. He’s the only sun-gazing practitioner left in the company, with a seven minute record, he doesn't like having lunch, but still agrees to go out for some pizza, when it comes to an after-office activity, and never refuses to share a beer.
