						Lio is one of our experts in Java and software architecture. However, the guy is not satisfied with that! He can also program not only extremely complex web applications in PHP, but also beautiful and modern front ends with CSS and Javascript. He’s always listening to cumbia on his headphones and every now and then you’ll hear him humming (generally one of Denis Elias’s hits). Outside work he enjoys reading a good book y playing football in honor of his idol Lio Messi.
