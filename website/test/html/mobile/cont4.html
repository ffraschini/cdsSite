	<p>Cortexa is a home management technology. With this software a user 
	can manage their house from virtually anywhere, even when they’re not 
	at home. It comes with a special hardware to be installed at the house, 
	and a user interface that can be accessed from any pc, mac, or mobile device. </p>
	<p>Some of the functionality it offers are: light control, thermostat control, 
	security (alarm set up), irrigation, leak detection, cameras, audio, weather
	forecast, modes setup and programming.</p>
	<p>We worked side by side with the client for almost seven months to developed 
	some sections of the Energy Saving edition released on July 2011. </p>
	<p>The project begun with the weather forecast service, that consisted in 
	finding a proper free online weather provider and integrating it with the 
	Cortexa software.</p>
	<p>We also developed the mode system, which is one of the featured functionalities
	of the new version. This system allows one to set up different modes for the house.
	Each mode has a group of dispositions that sets default temperatures, lighting, and 
	irrigation when the mode is activated. </p>
	<p>We also helped them develop a prototype to present for a hospitality project, 
	being Cortexa’s next big challenge in this industry: to develop a similar system for
	hotels.</p>
