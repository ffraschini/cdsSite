	<p>We developed a distributed and multi platform Trading System based on an algorithm provided by the client. The idea was to achieve an economic benefit in real-time financial markets through a completely automated process. The software is capable of receiving market data, filter it, and process the information using financial algorithms and it sends an order to the financial markets if there is an opportunity. 
	<br>We built connections with different technologies that provide market data and used the Financial Information eXchange ("FIX") Protocol to send messages. We were also in charge of website development, giving access to Auerbachâ€™s clients who chose to invest in their business. </p>
