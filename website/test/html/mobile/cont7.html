	<p>miPlan is a website developed in wordpress with custom PHP backend where customers 
	fill out different forms by answering questions in order to apply for life insurance
	cover.</p>
	<p>We developed the ‘apply’ section with backend processes in PHP, that checks
	if the user complies with the application needs and calculates estimated quotes for
	different types of insurances.
