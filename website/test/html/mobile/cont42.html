	<p>iPad/Server applications for doctors, nurses, and anaesthetists to record patient data. The idea is to to replace current ‘paper’ processes at different health centers. 
	<br><br>We initiated this project by developing a drug chart app for doctors to write medical prescriptions and patient information digitally instead of using paper forms; doctors can also generate templates in order to save time filling out the forms. 
	<br><br>After this, we developed an anesthetic chart app to monitor different procedures during an operation. This includes a graph showing the patient’s vital signs (the patient is connected to a monitor that sends the information to the server). The anaesthetists can take annotations and indicate which drugs and in which doses are prescribing to the patient during the operation. 
	<br><br>We also created a nurse app to register the conditions in which the patient arrives to the health center and assign the relevant physician.
