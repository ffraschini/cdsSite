							Agustin is always involved in several projects. Excellent at multitasking, he can start a new project for iPhone Labs, while taking care of the old and well-known applications. If you need to have remote access to your files using an iPhone, then he is the indicated one. At the office he is very famous for having no patience at all, mood swings and an exaggerated laugh, that can even wake the neighbors from their naps. Yes, he laughs THAT loud.
