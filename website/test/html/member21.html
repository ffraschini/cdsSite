							Marcos is the company’s revelation! If you need to build a server from dusk till dawn, then he is the guy you’re looking for. If you can actually manage to get him off his computer and exchange a few words with him, then you should call yourself lucky. Still, you don't need to do so, as he proves to be an incredible worker, 100% reliable, and an impeccable co-worker
